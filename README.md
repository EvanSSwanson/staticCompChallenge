# staticCompChallenge

### Abstract:
This was a quick challenge to recreate a static comp's layout ([Option 2](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/M2-static-comp-challenge.html)). The main focus of this project was to practice HTML and CSS skills.

### Context:
This project was completed during my third week of Mod 2 at Turing. It was our second solo project of the Mod and took me three days to complete. The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/M2-static-comp-challenge.html).

### Learning Goals:
- Expand knowledge of HTML and CSS
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript and leverage classes, creating and using an effective data model
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
- Refine your collaboration skills

### Technology Used
- VS Code
- HTML
- CSS
- Chrome Dev Tools
- Github

### Wins:
- I had a busy schedule at this time in Turing, so really focusing hard on this comp to get it done just two days after it was presented to us feels really good.
- Through this project, I developed a real confidence fo using flexbox and handling comps one small piece at a time.
- It was nice to think of a creative avenue that incorporated something I was interested in. This also, in my opinion, helped the project flow quicker.

### Challenges:
- Creating a comp is a rewarding feeling; but it can be tedious. Flexbox is no doubt a helpful tool, but by the time you reach HTML-container-inception, the brain begins to give out on you.
